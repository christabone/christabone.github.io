abstract: 'Biological knowledgebases are essential resources for biomedical researchers,
  providing ready access to gene function and genomic data. Professional, manual curation
  of knowledgebases, however, is labour-intensive and thus high-performing machine
  learning (ML) methods that improve biocuration efficiency are needed. Here, we report
  on sentence-level classification to identify biocuration-relevant sentences in the
  full text of published references for two gene function data types: gene expression
  and protein kinase activity. We performed a detailed characterization of sentences
  from references in the WormBase bibliography and used this characterization to define
  three tasks for classifying sentences as either (i) fully curatable, (ii) fully
  and partially curatable, or (iii) all language-related. We evaluated various ML
  models applied to these tasks and found that GPT and BioBERT achieve the highest
  average performance, resulting in F1 performance scores ranging from 0.89 to 0.99
  depending upon the task. Moreover, our inter-annotator agreement analyses and curator
  timing exercises demonstrated that curators readily converged on classification
  of high-quality training sentences that take a relatively short period of time to
  collect, making expansion of this approach to other data types a realistic addition
  to existing biocuration workflows. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of extracting
  biocuration-relevant sentences from full text. Integrating these models into professional
  biocuration workflows, such as those used by the Alliance of Genome Resources and
  the ACKnowledge community curation platform, might well facilitate efficient and
  accurate annotation of the biomedical literature.'
