abstract: FlyBase (flybase.org) is a model organism database and knowledge base about
  Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly. Researchers from around
  the world rely on the genetic, genomic, and functional information available in
  FlyBase, as well as its tools to view and interrogate these data. In this article,
  we describe the latest developments and updates to FlyBase. These include the introduction
  of single-cell RNA sequencing data, improved content and display of functional information,
  updated orthology pipelines, new chemical reports, and enhancements to our outreach
  resources.
