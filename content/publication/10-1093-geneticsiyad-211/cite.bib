 abstract = {FlyBase (flybase.org) is a model organism database and knowledge base about Drosophila melanogaster, commonly known as the fruit fly. Researchers from around the world rely on the genetic, genomic, and functional information available in FlyBase, as well as its tools to view and interrogate these data. In this article, we describe the latest developments and updates to FlyBase. These include the introduction of single-cell RNA sequencing data, improved content and display of functional information, updated orthology pipelines, new chemical reports, and enhancements to our outreach resources.},
