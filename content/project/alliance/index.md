The Alliance of Genome Resources is a collaborative platform uniting several model organism databases and the Gene Ontology Consortium to support comparative genomics research. Its mission is to develop and maintain a comprehensive genome resource, empowering researchers to explore the genetic and genomic underpinnings of human biology, health, and disease through the lens of diverse model organisms.
